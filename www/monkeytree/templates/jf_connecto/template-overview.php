	<h2>Gantry Framework Base Theme</h2>

	<p>The Gantry Framework base theme is a clean modern responsive design that is a great place to start when building your custom Gantry powered theme.</p>

	<h2>What is the Gantry Framework?</h2>

	<p>Gantry is a sophisticated framework with the sole intention of being the best platform to build a solid theme with.
	    Gantry takes all the lessons learned during the development of many RocketTheme Joomla templates and WordPress
	    Themes and distills that knowledge into a single super-flexible framework that is easy to configure, simple to
	    extend, and powerful enough to handle anything we want to throw at it.</p>
